# About Bloob.io

**Bloob.io** is a project of passion consisting of multiplayer browser games. I started to work on these games aiming to make them fun, configurable, and easily accessible.

# Localisation

While the project itself is not open source, the localisation is. Feel free to create pull requests with improvements, grammar fixes, or support for new languages.

# Why not open source the entire project?

Currently I am not comfortable with releasing all my hard work to the public. However, in the future it could very well be possible that I choose to make everything available.
